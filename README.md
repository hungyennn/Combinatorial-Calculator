### Part I
input: integers n, r, where 0<=r<=n<br>
1. results of P(n, r), with respect to n, r 
2. results of C(n, r), with respect to n, r
3. results of n^r, with respect to n, r
4. results of C(r+n-1, r), with respect to n, r

### Part II
input: integers n, 0<=n <br>
5. results of the first n Catalan number, with respect to n<br>
6. results of the first n triangular number, with respect to n<br>
7. results of the first n harmonic number, with respect to n<br>
